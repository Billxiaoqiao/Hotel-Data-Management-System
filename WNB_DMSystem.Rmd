## Report - Approach Outline & ER diagram

According to the requirement of WNB Hotel Group, a database for the revenue management optimization system was designed, which contains the information records of the guests, hotels, room and facility reservations, guest's transactions and invoices.

![Entity Relation Diagram](er.png)

The entity relation of this system will be established as follows:

### Entities


* **GUEST** ($\underline{Guest\_ID}$, Country, Phone_number(o), Email_address(o), 
  
  G_Street_address, First_name, Middle_name(o), Last_name)


The GUEST entity represents each guest of the hotel with attributes: Guest_ID, Country, Phone_number(o), Email_address(o), G_Street_address, Name. Name is a composite attribute that can be subdivided into three component attributes: First_name, Middle_name(o), Last_name. A unique Guest_ID is created as the primary key since Name and G_Street_address attributes of the a guest may be duplicated. Email_address, Middle_name and Phone_number attributes are optional to fill in. Phone_number is a multi-valued attribute which could be home, work or cell numbers.


* **HOTEL** ($\underline{Hotel\_ID}$, H_Name, Primary_phone_number, Web_address, 
  
  Street_number, Street_name, City, Postal_code, State)
  
The HOTEL entity stands for each hotel in the WNB Hotel Group with attributes: Hotel_ID, H_Name, Primary_phone_number, Web_address, H_Street_address.H_Street_address is a composite attribute that can be subdivided into five component attributes: Street_number, Street_name, City, Postal_code, State. Hotel_ID is established as the primary key of the HOTEL entity because H_Name and Primary_phone_number attributes may be duplicated. 


* **BOOKING_CHANNEL** (Channel_type, Booking_fee(o), Available_room(o), 
  
  $\underline{\underline{Guest\_ID}, \underline{Hotel\_ID}, \underline{Reservation\_ID}}$)

The BOOKING_CHANNEL entity is an associative entity with attributes: Channel_type, connecting with three entities: GUEST, HOTEL, and RESERVATION. Channel_type attribute can be the hotel booking system or a specific booking platform (e.g., Booking.com, Hotels.com, TripAdvisor.com, etc.). Channel_type attribute could be duplicated. Thus, the primary key of the BOOKING_CHANNEL entity is established as a composite primary key composed of Hotel_ID, Guest_ID, and Reservation_ID. 


* **RESERVATION** ($\underline{Reservation\_ID}$, Expiration_date, 
  
  Credit_card_number, Preference(o), $\underline{\underline{Hotel\_ID}}$)
  
The RESERVATION entity is a vital entity associated with TRANSACTION, HOTEL, BOOKING CHANNEL, and ROOM, which records the guests' booking of rooms and facilities, and will be deleted after the booking process. The RESERVATION entity has attributes Reservation_ID, Preference(o), Credit_card. Credit_card attribute is a composite attribute that can be subdivided into five component attributes: Expiration_date, Credit_card_number. The length of Credit_card_number is at most 16 bits, therefore INT (16) is stated for the variable. Moreover, the RESERVATION entity has a multi-valued attribute: PREFERENCE, which stores the customer's room requirements and will be compared with the corresponding values of the ROOM entity. Hotels will cross out the RESERVATION entity after the customer completes the RESERVATION. 

Apart from that, the value of the RESERVATION entity needs to be transferred into other entities. The Reservation_id, is established as the primary key to distinguish each reservation.


* **ROOM** ($\underline{\underline{Hotel\_ID}, \underline{Reservation\_ID}}$, 
  
  Room_ID, NB_of_bed, Floor, Smoking_cond, Departure_date, Arrival_date)
  
The ROOM entity takes every room's accommodation records as a historical database. The ROOM entity is a associative entity with attributes Room_ID, NB_of_bed, Floor, Smoking_cond. The value of Room_ID attribute may be iterated with different reservation records. Therefore, ROOM is founded as an associative entity, which combines Hotel_ID and Reservation_ID as ROOM's primary key to confirm ROOM reservations and hotel information. The property NB_of_bed reflects the number of beds in one room. Meanwhile, Floor and Smoking_cond include the floor and smoking condition of each room.


* **TRANSACTION** ($\underline{Transaction\_ID}$, O_service_type, O_price, 
  
  RA_service_type, RA_price, AR_service_type, AR_price, Room_rate, 
  
  $\underline{\underline{Guest\_ID}, \underline{Reservation\_ID}, \underline{Invoice\_ID}}$)
  
The TRANSACTION entity records billing information for accommodation or other expenses. The TRANSACTION entity has an attribute, the Transaction_ID. To uniquely identify each transaction (OTHER SERVICES, ROOM ADDITIONAL SERVICE, ANCILLARY REVENUE, and ROOM_rate), Transaction_ID is defined as the primary key in TRANSACTION entity.


* **INVOICE** ($\underline{Invoice\_ID}$, Total_charge, Discription, Amount_of_charge, 
  
  Total_balance, Displayed_form, Payment_form, Amount_of_money, $\underline{\underline{Guest\_ID}}$)
  
The INVOICE entity represents the invoice of guests' each stay with attributes: Total_charge, Receipt_line_item, Total_balance, Displayed_form, Invoice_ID. Invoice_ID attribute is defined as the primary key to distinguish the invoices. Corresponding line items are generated separately and stored together in the displayed form based on the information sent from TRANSACTION and PAYMENT. The hotel will generate the invoice by Invoice_ID with the specific Displayed_form.


### Relations

![BOOKING_CHANNEL Relation](bc.png)

 * **BOOKING_CHANNEL**

The relationship between GUEST and BOOKING CHANNEL is 1:1 (one-to-one relationship). A guest makes one reservation only from one booking channel. Moreover, all customers must book through the channel (fully participate).

 * **RESERVES_FROM**

Each booking channel can make multiple reservations 1:N (one-to-many relationship): each order corresponds to only one booking channel, but a channel can accept more than one order. Not all booking channels are involved in making reservations, but all reservations are booked through the channel. If the customer cancels the order before checking in, the corresponding BOOKING_CHANNEL entity will be deleted by the system, and the reservation will be deleted accordingly.

 * **ACCEPTS**
 
Reservations to hotels are 1: N relation. The hotel provides at least two available rooms for guests to book on the platform for each booking channel. Besides, the hotel will pay specific booking fees to the channel every month. If the channel type is a hotel booking system, the two attributes will be null.

![ROOM Relation](room.png)

 * **HAS**

Hotel accepts orders (1: N) and provides rooms owned by the hotel in the light of the preference of the order (1: N) .

 * **INFORMS**
 
 The reservation will inform the ROOM entity the guests' arrival and departure date, which will be stored in ROOM entity (1:N) .

![TRANSACTION and relations](tr.png)

 * **ROOM_ADDITIONAL_SERVICE, **
 
   **ANCILLARY_REVENUE, **
   
   **RECORD_AS,**
   
   **OTHER_SERVICES**

After the customer's reservation is completed, the reservation generates the TRANSACTIONs (including Room Additional Service, Ancillary revenue, and Room_rate) (1: N) . Other services (1: N) during guest stay is recorded as transaction as well, based on service type and price and identified by the Guest_ID. Once the guest's reservation is confirmed, the system will remove their reservation data.

![INVOICE and relations](in.png)

 * **GENERATES**

The customer's charges are transferred from multiple transactions to INVOICE (1: N). The bill shows the amount needed to be paid and the description of each charged service. The total amount is generated according to the Applicable Tax.

 * **PAYMENT**

After each payment, the type and amount of money will be converted into Line_item and recorded in the corresponding invoice, containing all services (all listed inline items) and the total balance. After the guest pays all the expenses, the total balance is 0. Each guest will have one invoice (1: 1) for each stay.

\newpage
## Appendix - Part A1 SQL Code

MySQL has more powerful database syntaxes than SQLite, such as add foreign keys after the tables have been created. Therefore, in this case, the 'RMySQL' package, which is a MySQL 'DBI' interface package suitable for R, is adopted.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, encoding='UTF-8')
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Install DBI & RMySQL packages if haven't installed before
#install.packages(c('DBI','RMySQL'))
library(DBI)
library(RMySQL)
#connect to local MySQL server database 'WNB'
my_connection <- RMySQL::dbConnect(MySQL(), dbname = 'WNB1', username = "root", 
                                   password = 'rootpwd') 
```

There are several cross references in ER diagram. However, SQL execute by sentence not by chunk. If foreign keys are inserted during creating tables, there will be undefined foreign keys. Thus creating entity & relationship tables without foreign key is needed first.

P.S. due to MySQL syntax, declaring the foreign keys exist as attributes in tables is also mandatory.

### SQL Definition(DDL)

 PRIMARY KEY(Guest_ID)
); 
```

);
```

After defining table, alter the attributes to foreign key constraints so that tables are having relations.

```{sql connection=my_connection}
ALTER TABLE BOOKING_CHANNEL ADD FOREIGN KEY(Guest_ID) references GUEST(Guest_ID);
```
```{sql connection=my_connection}
ALTER TABLE BOOKING_CHANNEL ADD FOREIGN KEY(Reservation_ID) references 
RESERVATION(Reservation_ID);
```
```{sql connection=my_connection}
ALTER TABLE BOOKING_CHANNEL ADD FOREIGN KEY(Hotel_ID) references HOTEL(Hotel_ID);
```
```{sql connection=my_connection}
ALTER TABLE ROOM ADD FOREIGN KEY(Hotel_ID) references HOTEL(Hotel_ID);
```
```{sql connection=my_connection}
ALTER TABLE ROOM ADD FOREIGN KEY(Reservation_ID) 
references RESERVATION(Reservation_ID);
```
```{sql connection=my_connection}
ALTER TABLE RESERVATION ADD FOREIGN KEY(Hotel_ID) 
references HOTEL(Hotel_ID);
```
```{sql connection=my_connection}
ALTER TABLE TRANSACTION ADD FOREIGN KEY(Guest_ID) 
references GUEST(Guest_ID);
```
```{sql connection=my_connection}
ALTER TABLE TRANSACTION ADD FOREIGN KEY(Reservation_ID) 
references RESERVATION(Reservation_ID);
```
```{sql connection=my_connection}
ALTER TABLE TRANSACTION ADD FOREIGN KEY(Invoice_ID) 
references INVOICE(Invoice_ID);
```
```{sql connection=my_connection}
ALTER TABLE INVOICE ADD FOREIGN KEY(Guest_ID) references GUEST(Guest_ID);
```

* **Query(business questions solving)**

Provide the SQL queries as follows that satisfy business goals`(Reservation information is deleted after reservation, thus Reservation_ID selection must via entity ROOM)`:

 *  `Use SUM '+' to get total spend`
  
 *  `Use IFNULL to convert null data to '0'`
  
#### The total spent for the customer for a particular stay (checkout invoice).

```{sql connection=my_connection}
SELECT SUM(IFNULL(TRANSACTION.O_price,0)) + SUM(IFNULL(TRANSACTION.RA_Price,0)) +
SUM(IFNULL(TRANSACTION.AR_Price,0)) + SUM(IFNULL(TRANSACTION.Room_rate,0)) 
AS Total_Spent
FROM TRANSACTION, ROOM
WHERE TRANSACTION.Guest_ID = 'A001'
AND TRANSACTION.Reservation_ID = ROOM.Reservation_ID
AND ROOM.Arrival_date = DATE '2021-09-29'
AND ROOM.Departure_date = DATE '2021-09-30';
```

#### The most valuable customers in (a) the last two months, (b) past year and (c) from the beginning of the records.

 *  `Use CONCAT to form two selected columns to one`
  
 *  `Use DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 0 DAY) to get current date`
  
 *  `Use LIMIT 5 and ORDER BY DESC to get the biggest 5 Customer_value numbers`
  
(a) The last two months:

```{sql connection=my_connection}
SELECT CONCAT(GUEST.First_name,' ',IFNULL(GUEST.Middle_name,''),' ',GUEST.Last_name) 
AS Customer_name, GUEST.Guest_ID AS ID, SUM(IFNULL(TRANSACTION.O_price,0)) +
SUM(IFNULL(TRANSACTION.RA_Price,0)) + SUM(IFNULL(TRANSACTION.AR_Price,0)) +
SUM(IFNULL(TRANSACTION.Room_rate,0)) AS Customer_value
FROM TRANSACTION, ROOM, GUEST
WHERE TRANSACTION.Reservation_ID = ROOM.Reservation_ID
AND TRANSACTION.Guest_ID = GUEST.Guest_ID
AND ROOM.Arrival_date > DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 60 DAY)
AND ROOM.Departure_date < DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 0 DAY)
GROUP BY ID
ORDER BY Customer_value DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

(b) Past year

```{sql connection=my_connection}
SELECT CONCAT(GUEST.First_name,' ',IFNULL(GUEST.Middle_name,''),' ',GUEST.Last_name)

* SQLite is a local database integrated in the application. Moreover, SQLite is very convenient to transplant and apply when facing with small amount of data. Therefore, SQLite is adopted to the dealer data analysis.

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(RSQLite)
my_connection1 <- RSQLite::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(),"Vehicle.db") 
```

## Logical Data Schema

  * **Customers**($\underline{Cust\_id}$)
  * **Vehicles**($\underline{Vehicle\_id}$, $\underline{\underline{Cust\_id}}$, $\underline{\underline{Dealer\_name}}$, V_price, Purchase_date)
  * **Dealers**($\underline{Dealer\_name}$)
  * **Vehicle_services**($\underline{Transaction\_id}$, $\underline{\underline{Cust\_id}}$, $\underline{\underline{Dealer\_name}}$, $\underline{\underline{Vehicle\_id}}$, Service_package(O), Nominal_s_fee(O), V_mileage, Service_date)
  
![ER Diagram](A2ER.png)
  
The entities of the schema will be established as follows:

 * **Customer**
 
The CUSTOMER entity represents every guest purchasing vehicles from the brand. The CUSTOMER_ID is created as the primary key for uniquely identifying the guests.

 * **Vehicle**
 
The Vehicle stores every vehicle of the brand which the dealer has sold. The primary key of this entity is Vehicle_id. The attributes V_price, Purchase_date are stored to record the specific conditions of the vehicle.  Moreover, Customer_ID and Dealer_name are the foreign keys to identify the vehicle's seller and owner.

 * **Dealer**
 
The DEALER records every single dealer of the brand. The primary key of Dealer is Dealer_name.

 * **Vehicle_service**
 
The Vehicle_service represents every maintenance service provided by the dealers. The primary key of this entity is Transaction_id. Meanwhile, Customer_id, Dealer_name, and Vehicle_id are used as foreign keys relating to each service. The entity also stores V_mileage and Service_date to record the customer's vehicle service and vehicle status.
